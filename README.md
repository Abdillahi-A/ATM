## Task
Implement a simple 'ATM' application.

### Requirements
User can interact with the code using a REPL like IRB or with the JavaScript console.
User can make deposits and withdrawals.
User should not be able to withdraw more money than they have in their account.
User can print their account statement which should show date, amount withdrawn/deposited and balance.
The account statement should be printed in descending order (latest date first).
### Extensions
Once you have fulfilled the basic functionality of the game, you can choose to implement these additional user stories.

Store the transaction data in memory - doesn't have to be a DB, you can use a CSV file.
User can print their account statements for a specific month.
